How the internet work
=====================

There are two main concepts that are fundamental to the way the Internet functions: packets and protocols.

Packets
-------

In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each packet contains both data and information about that data. When data gets sent over the Internet, it is first broken up into smaller packets, which are then translated into bits. Packets are sent across the Internet using a technique called packet switching. Intermediary routers and switches are able to process packets independently from each other, without accounting for their source or destination.

Protocols
---------

In networking, a protocol is a standardized way of doing certain actions and formatting data so that two or more devices are able to communicate with and understand each other. There are protocols for sending packets between devices on the same network (Ethernet), for sending packets from network to network (IP), for ensuring those packets successfully arrive in order (TCP), and for formatting data for websites and applications (HTTP). In addition to these foundational protocols, there are also protocols for routing, testing, and encryption. And there are alternatives to the protocols listed above for different types of content - for instance, streaming video often uses UDP instead of TCP.

What is a web server and how does it work?
==========================================

A server is a computer that runs applications and services ranging from websites to instant messaging. It's called a server because it provides a service to another computer and its user also known as the client. Is typically stored in something called a data center with hundreds or thousands of other servers, all running different services connected to the internet. A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

What are websites and webpages?
===============================

What is a Website?
------------------

A website is a combination or collection of webpages grouped together, often handled by a person or an organisation, which can be accessed anywhere and anytime by anyone via the internet. This is also a good method to market the businesses and help them grow well. Al these pages are linked together using the hyperlinks. Websites can also be either static or interactive. In the meantime, some popular categories of websites are affiliate websites, e-commerce websites, dating websites, social networking websites and more.

What is a Webpage?
------------------

Webpage, in the meanwhile, is a single document or page that is displayed in web browsers like the Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and so on. This is used to make up the World Wide Web (WWW) and is used chiefly to sell products and services to users or visitors. A unique URL address is also attached to the webpages and is used to render or access that particular page. Webpages can also be either static or dynamic.

What is a web browser and how does it work?
===========================================

A web browser takes you anywhere on the internet. It retrieves information from other parts of the web and displays it on your desktop or mobile device. The information is transferred using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which defines how text, images and video are transmitted on the web. When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server, it uses a piece of software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images. This data is written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and web browsers read this code to create what we see, hear and experience on the internet.

Web hosting
===========

A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that hosts websites for clients, i.e. it offers the facilities required for them to create and maintain a site and makes it accessible on the World Wide Web. Companies providing web hosting services are sometimes called web hosts.

How Does Web Hosting Work?
--------------------------

When you set up an online business, you have a series of files, images, and HTML code that make up your website. These files take up space and need a place to live. Without an online home, your files would just sit on your computer and no one would ever see them. A hosting provider will provide a place on a web server to store all of your files and are responsible for delivering the files of your website as soon as a browser makes a request by typing in your domain name.

What is a Domain Name?
----------------------

if you are renting space at a physical location for your business, you give customers. your street address so they can find you. If you are renting space on the internet, you give customers your domain name. Whenever someone types in your domain name, it is converted into an IP address. The hosting company then locates all the files connected to your IP address and returns all of the pictures, videos, and words that make up your website.

How to Choose a Hosting Provider?
---------------------------------

When selecting a provider it is important to consider the different types of hosting services that are offered. Here are a few things to consider when determining where vou would like to host your site.

*   What type of website are you building? eCommerce, blog, portfolio, etc.
*   Based on the type website, what is the bandwidth needed to run your site
*   Can you create email addresses for vour domain?
*   What type of hosting options are available?
*   Do they provide SSL Certificates?

Types of Web Hosting
--------------------

1.  Shared Hosting
2.  Dedicated Hosting
3.  VPS Hosting
4.  Cloud Hosting

### Shared Hosting

Shared hosting is the most common type of web hosting and is suitable for most online business owners. With shared hosting, several customers share storage space on one powerful server. There are several advantages to shared hosting including:

*   Affordability - It's much cheaper to share the space on a server than to rent the entire machine.
*   Ease of use- Your server is preconfigured, well-organized, easy to use, and your hosting company does all the maintenance and security updates for you.

### Dedicated Hosting

Rather than sharing space, you get a server all to yourself if you choose a dedicated hosting package. Advantages to dedicated hosting include:

*   Customization - You can customize the software and hardware to meet your individual needs
*   Unlimited Resources- Since you don't share the server with anyone, all the storage space is yours.
*   Full control - You can configure the setup however you'd like.

### VPS Hosting

Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting includes all the features of a dedicated server, but at the price point of a shared server. Here are some of the top reasons VPS hosting might be a great fit:

*   Functionality - VPS hosting is built on a cPanel and supports easy navigation with several intuitive tools.
*   One-click features - You have access to one-click installs of WordPress, Magento, and Drupal.
*   Easy site navigation - The clean interface makes site management a cinch.

Cloud Hosting
-------------

Cloud hosting is often considered the most reliable of all of the services. Rather than relying on disk space of a single server, it pulls its power from several resources, making sure you never have any downtime. Other benefits include:

*   Scalability - You can add to your cloud space at any time.
*   Unmetered bandwidth - You don't have to worry about your site going down due to a server failure.

Internet Protocols
==================

The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed. Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.

HTTP
====

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

HTTP Methods

Description

GET

The client requests a resource on the web server

POST

The client submits data to a resource on the web server

PUT

The client replaces a resource on the web server

DELETE

The client deletes a resource on the web server

Frameworks and Libraries
========================

What is Framework?
------------------

Frameworks are program scaffolds that supply the blueprint instead of a finished product. As a result, a framework gives the fundamental structure while indicating the required customization from the coder. The framework defines the workflow of a software application, informs the developer of what he needs, and invokes the developer's code when necessary.

What is Library?
----------------

A library is a group of pre-written codes that make jobs easier to complete. A library is a collection of pre-defined methods and classes that developers can use to ease their work and accelerate development. As a result, developers do not need to write code to achieve specific features. Most programming languages include standard libraries, but developers can create their own customized libraries.

Web Application & Website
=========================

Web Application
---------------

Web application is a piece of software that can be accessed by the browser. A Browser is an application that is used to browse the internet. Web application needs authentication. The web application uses a combination of server-side scripts and client-side scripts to present information. It requires a server to manage requests from the users. Example: Google Apps, Amazon, YouTube

Website
-------

Website is a collection of related web pages that contains images, text, audio, video, etc. It can be consist of one page, two pages, and n number of pages. Awebsite provides visual and text content that users can view and read. To view a website requires a browser(Chrome, Firefox). There are many types of websites like Archive website, Blog, Community website, etc.

What is an API Application Programming Interface?
=================================================

The term API, also known as Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols and definitions that can allow one application to communicate with the other application. It is a computing interface that is being used to define interactions between various software intermediaries. It will define the kinds of requests and calls that can be made. It is an information gateway that will allow the software and services' backend to communicate with each other.

What is an IDE?
===============

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program. IDEs increase programmer productivity by combining common activities of writing software into a single application: editing source code, building executables, and debugging.
